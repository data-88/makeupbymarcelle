I started my makeup journey over 10 years ago. I walked into the MAC makeup store at closing time to purchase some products and it was only the manager and one makeup artist in the store. The makeup artist, Lungi and I got chatting as she was testing the colour of the concealer on my face.I mentioned to her that I was to start a makeup artistry course the next year. She proceeded to ask me whether I was looking fo work. She called Chris, the manager at the time and he told me to bring my CV to him and we will take it from there. I didn’t think I stood a chance at all not being a qualified makeup artist. After some time not receiving any response I gave up on the idea and then they contacted me to come in for my first interview. Long story short after 3 interviews I actually got the job and was hired as an associate makeup artist. 

I started my makeup artistry course at Face to Face Makeup and Beauty school where I graduated with a certificate as a makeup artist and a certificate in prosthetics. I also received my international diploma, CIDESCO - internationally certified and recognised as a professional make up artist. Throughout my studies I worked at MAC on weekends and gained so much additional knowledge about makeup, the products and correct application thereof. I completed my makeup artistry qualification and worked for MAC for almost 7 years. I gained such valuable experience and it was a great journey.

I work with applications to all skin types and tones. I only work with quality products and use a wide range that is safe to use on all skin types.

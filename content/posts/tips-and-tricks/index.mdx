One way to get a more natural base, is to mix a little moisturiser into your foundation." It'll dial down the coverage and give skin a dewier, natural finish.

For a glowier finish, Dominic recommends "adding a smidge of MAC's Strobe Cream to any foundation". "Not only will it reduce the heaviness of any base, but it'll instantly increase your glow and leave skin looking fresh & natural.

It can be tempting to go OTT with concealer, but this can lead to ashy undereyes and caking.

Mascara can be super heavy (which isn't always a bad thing), but if you're trying to achieve a softer look big lashes can be too much.A trick I often use, is to apply mascara as usual, but then use two cotton buds with a little makeup remover and pinch the lashes between them to remove some of the excess mascara.

A great shadow for a soft natural eye is just a wash of bronzing powder. Sweep it over the whole lid and then add a little more into the socket. It’s a soft look that adds natural definition.

A great tip to define your eyes without a dramatic liner look, is to apply a black or brown eye pencil to the top and bottom waterlines of your eye. After applying it, close your eyes really tight - this will push the pigment into the roots of your lashes, deepening the appearance of your natural lashline. Then, take a cotton bud and remove the majority of the pencil from the waterline, leaving just the pigment at the roots of your lashes. Your lashes will look naturally defined, with zero harsh lines.

Intimidated by all those crazy-looking contour videos? You're not the only one. Take MAC's Bronzing Powder in Matte Bronze and sweep it under the cheek, running from the top of the ear towards, but not touching, the corner of the lip. It works so well and I use this technique on all my clients.

Matte lipstick is still a huge trend, but the bold pigmentation can be a little overwhelming if you want to achieve a natural makeup look. For a softer finish, grab your favourite matte lipstick, then dampen a small fluffy makeup brush with a little MAC Prep+Prime Fix+, next, use the brush to buff the colour into your lips creating a diffused, long-lasting, matte lip stain.

Hello I'm Marcelle. I'm a make up artist based in Johannesburg. 

I believe makeup has the power to transform our perceptions of ourselves. 

My approach to makeup is to enhance the clients features with a natural “no makeup makeup” look. I love a natural look but there is so much you can do with makeup. My aim is to increase my clients confidence and teach them how to look their best with minimal makeup.
